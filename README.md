Trying to do the tutorial on server and client side technologies!

Client-side programming refers to the software that runs on the client. If the client is a browser, that usually means Java applets, ActiveX components, JavaScript, etc.  If the client is a phone or non-Windows tablet, then you also include objective-C and such.  If the client is a PC or laptop, then there are even more choices.
 
Server-side programming refers to the software that runs on the server.  Server systems include (but are not limited to) database systems (e.g. MySQL, Oracle), HTTP servers (e.g. Apache, IIS), and application servers (which might be Java based, or other languages). SQL and PHP are used to write programming (scripting) code that runs on servers, while Java, C#, C++ and such are used to write software that expands the processing functions of the base server, or can act as servers on their own.
